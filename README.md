# Salon Sync

## Description

Salon Sync is an ASP.Net Core MVC Framework web application that showcases full stack development by seamlessly integrating front-end, back-end, and database technologies to create a comprehensive salon management solution. Through its user-friendly interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, salon owners and stylists can easily interact with the application, creating appointments, viewing client preferences, and staying up to date with upcoming schedules.  

The application's database, powered by cloud-based technologies such as Firebase, stores critical salon information securely, including client profiles, appointment schedules, and stylist information. By leveraging the power of full stack development, Salon Sync ensures data integrity, scalability, and reliability.  

Overall, Salon Sync exemplifies the synergy between front-end, back-end, and database technologies, offering a complete salon management solution that is intuitive, efficient, and adaptable.  

Salon Sync was developed as a portfolio project to demonstrate my full stack development skills and address the need for a salon management solution. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of MVC frameworks and crafted an intuitive user interface. Salon Sync challenged me to handle various aspects of software development, from database design to seamless integration of technologies. It reflects my commitment to creating practical solutions that prioritize usability and efficiency.
